## Credits Daily Burn Rate
This dashboard shows totals for each credit consumption type using the data volume tier index and search audit (for infrequent scans).

It's particularly useful if your current credits usage rate is quite different to your year to date (YTD) usage prediction on the account page.

Note: 
- the billing account page in Sumo measures days in pacific time so if you want to get very close correlation to those daily figures you need to set your sumo user TZ to PT
- the parameter on the dashboard for your plan's annual credits amount will have to be customized when you set up the dashboard
- storage can only be estimated as there is no storage dimension in data volume. Use the parameters in the dash and tweak by comparing to your account page to get a close estimate value.
